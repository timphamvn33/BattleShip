If the slot on the human’s board is empty,a “MISS” message is displayed. Print out the computer’s board and the human’s board as described at the bottom of the page.
After the computer goes, have the human pick a slot to “fire” at. If the slot the human picked on the computer’s board is a ship, a “HIT” message is displayed. If the slot on the computer’s board
is empty, a “MISS” message is displayed. Print out the computer’s board and the human’s board
Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there is a winner. The computer wins if both of the human’s ship slots
are hit. The human wins if both of the computer’s ship slots are hit.
